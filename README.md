- This README is a mix of what you can expect from me, and what I expect from you. It is still a work in progress, any feedback you have is most welcome.

- ## Feedback
    - I want, and will solicit, feedback during our meetings
    - Tell me when you feel I have messed up
    - I want to hear disagreements and I want to discuss them. 
    - I enjoy playing devils advocate, try not to interpret this as me constantly being difficult
    - If you have feedback to give, don't hesitate to book me; book me book me book me
  
- ## Ask Questions
    - If you are unsure about anything, ask sooner rather than later.
    - Early in my career, a colleague who joined the company at the same time as myself mentioned that for the past year their goal was to ask a question in every meeting. "Would anyone like a coffee?", "shall I close the door?", anything that would force them to use their voice in that room with those people. I immediately took his idea and used it aggressively. As someone who is introverted, I found it incredibly helpful in encouraging me to speak up when I did have a question or a comment to make at a meeting. I encourage anyone who might be remotely shy in meetings to give this technique a spin.

- ## Growth
    - I want the people I work with to continue to grow and develop. It's good for them, good for the team and also pushes me to continue to grow, win, win win.
    - If you're not growing, or being challenged enough, I want to hear it and address it

- ## Transparency
    - Transparency is crucial to me. I expect it from everyone I work with.
    - I will be as transparent as I can about what is going on across the company and in my own views of the team and company.
    - I commit not to lie to anyone
    - We should always default to open, there should be very very few situations when a meeting or document needs to be kept private.

- ## Conviction
    - "Strong opinions, weakly held"
    - I often have a strong belief in what the correct course of action should be. This doesn't mean I am not willing to hear differing views, quite the opposite, please try and convince me why I am wrong/your are correct.

- ## Critical Thinking
    - Nothing is sacred in how we work. We should continuously challenge what we are doing and how we are doing it. If we need to scrap a big chunk of work, so be it.

- ## Change
    - I have a high tolerance of change and believe change is good; from team and company structures, to areas of focus within a business to seating arrangements.
    - I need to know if you do not have a high tolerance of change. I will try and be aware when those I work with are struggling with change, if it seems like I am not, please point this out to me.

- ## 1:1s
    - 1:1s YOUR time:
        - How you are doing
        - What you need
        - What you wish could be different
        - How you feel about the team/company
        - Your career goals
